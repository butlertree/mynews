- Create a multi-page UX using Router

## 🥇 Wins
⭐ Successfully use React and React Router
⭐ Successfully implement cypress testing
⭐ Successfully navigating a public api and accessing its data for the application.  

## 🚧 Challenges
❗ It was more challenging working with a public api that restricted my my requests.  Also, the data was at times incomplete or missing alltogether requiring some filtering and design choices.
